# improved-Floyd-Algorithm

We all know shortest path problem and its solution Floyd Algorithm, but it's under an assumption that when you get to a point, you can immediately move on to the next point. What if you need to stay for a while in some nodes before you restart? For example, you need to transfer at an airports. However, you may have to wait for a long time in the waiting hall because the next plane you will board won't land for another 3 hours. The improved Floyd Algorithm is for solving this problem.
